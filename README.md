<h2>An animated green grid to play with.</h2>

The calming squares glow and flicker, and shyly hide from your mouse pointer.

The HTML file contains an empty wrapper; the grid is written on load in Javascript.

As I re-familiarize myself with JS, I'm writing lots of code only to erase it and replace it with a few lines of CSS. My initial solution set an interval and flipped the class of the wrapper every tick. This version presets a CSS animation.

You can see the original animation on <a href="https://codepen.io/warnthepenguins/pen/YZWzpw">my Codepen</a>.
